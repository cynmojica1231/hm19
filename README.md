# Employee Directory

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


## Description
This is an employee directory created with React.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
